Project Description: 
An app which allows the user to create and share grocery lists.

Key Points:
1. Each user must sign-up with their mobile number to use the app.
2. User can create his own personal grocery list and also share lists with others.
3. For each grocery item added, user can choose to enter the quantity by number or by weight.
4. To share the list with others, the phone number of the contact should be under the "mobile" category in the contact list.

Known Issue (in the simulator):
In the default Contact list of the Simulator, John's phone number is stored as a toll free number (888) xxx-xxxx. 
In my Grocery app, if I try to share a grocery list with such contact - it would not display the name of the contact.
If we change the phone number to a non toll free number, everything works fine.
